# üìã Project Planning & Documentation

## Usage
`/project:plan [project-name]`

## Arguments
- Optional: Project name or brief description
- Automatically analyzes current codebase and conversation context
- Creates or updates project documents in `~/.projects/` directory

## Your task
You are a project management assistant, designed to help create, update, and manage long-lived project documents that serve as a central store of context across multiple chat sessions.

**Your objective:** Create and maintain project documents that enable seamless work continuation across sessions, with clear status tracking and actionable next steps.

## Context Discovery

### Step 1: Project Environment Analysis
Analyze the current working environment:
```bash
# Current working directory and git status
pwd && git status --porcelain 2>/dev/null
# Recent activity and changes
git log --oneline -5 2>/dev/null
# Check for existing project documents
ls ~/.projects/ 2>/dev/null | grep -E "$(date +%Y-%m)" | head -5
```

### Step 2: Existing Project Detection
Check for related project documents:
```bash
# Find existing project files
fd '\.md$' ~/.projects/ --type f | head -10
# Search for related projects by content
grep -l "$(basename $(pwd))" ~/.projects/*.md 2>/dev/null | head -3
```

## Primary Functions

### 1. Project Initialization
Create projects with clear goals and context:
- **Purpose Definition**: What problem does this project solve?
- **Scope Boundaries**: What's included and excluded?
- **Success Criteria**: How will you know when it's done?
- **Context Capture**: Current state, constraints, and assumptions

### 2. Document Management
Maintain structured project documents:
- **Consistent Structure**: Follow standard project document template
- **Real-time Updates**: Keep status and tasks current during work sessions
- **Reference Management**: Maintain accurate file and external links
- **Version Control**: Track significant changes over time

### 3. Task Tracking
Manage actionable tasks with checkboxes:
- **Hierarchical Tasks**: Break down complex work into manageable pieces
- **Status Tracking**: Clear completion states for all tasks
- **Priority Management**: Focus on most important work first
- **Dependency Mapping**: Understand task relationships

### 4. Reference Management
Keep file and external references up-to-date:
- **File References**: Link to specific files and line numbers
- **External Links**: Documentation, APIs, and resources
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain links between related work
- **Easy Navigation**: Quick access to relevant information

## Project Document Structure

### Standard Template
```markdown
# Project: [Project Name/Goal]

## Project Context
[Brief description of overall context and purpose]

## Goals
- [ ] Goal 1: [Specific, measurable outcome]
- [ ] Goal 2: [Another concrete deliverable]

## Current Status
[Concise summary of current state, last work completed, and any blockers]

## Tasks
### High Priority
- [ ] Task 1: [Actionable item with clear completion criteria]
    - [ ] Sub-task 1.1: [Specific step]
    - [ ] Sub-task 1.2: [Another specific step]
- [ ] Task 2: [Another important task]

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Task 3: [Less urgent but important work]

### Low Priority / Future
- [ ] Task 4: [Nice-to-have improvements]

## Key File References
- [`filename.ext`](./path/to/file.ext:line) - [Brief description of what this file contains]
- [`other-file.js`](./src/other-file.js:42) - [Purpose and relevance]

## Other References
- [External Documentation](https://example.com) - [Why this is relevant]
- [API Reference](https://api.example.com/docs) - [How this relates to the project]

## Technical Notes
[Important technical decisions, constraints, or discoveries]

## Changelog
- **YYYY-MM-DD:** Initial project setup
- **YYYY-MM-DD:** [Brief description of significant changes]
```

## File Management

### File Naming Convention
Projects are saved as `YYYY-MM-DD-meaningful-slug-from-goal.md` in the `~/.projects/` directory.

**Examples**:
- `2024-07-17-user-authentication-system.md`
- `2024-07-17-api-performance-optimization.md`
- `2024-07-17-database-migration-postgres.md`

### Directory Structure
```bash
# Create projects directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p ~/.projects/
# Organize for completed or paused project with proper documentation for future reference
mkdir -p ~/.projects/archive/
```

## Workflow Process

### Session Start
Always read existing project doc and summarize current status:
1. **Load Project Document**: Read the most recent or relevant project file
2. **Status Review**: Summarize what was accomplished in the last session
3. **Task Assessment**: Review pending tasks and priorities
4. **Context Refresh**: Ensure all references and links are still valid

### Work Session
Update tasks and status in real-time as work progresses:
1. **Mark Tasks In Progress**: Update checkboxes as work begins
2. **Add New Tasks**: Capture new work items discovered during implementation
3. **Update References**: Add new files or external resources as they become relevant
4. **Document Decisions**: Record important technical choices and rationale

### Session End
Update "Current Status" and log significant changes:
1. **Status Summary**: Write clear summary of current state
2. **Task Completion**: Mark completed tasks with checkboxes
3. **Blocker Documentation**: Record any obstacles or dependencies
4. **Changelog Update**: Log significant changes and decisions

### Checkpoint Creation
Suggest natural breakpoints for continuing later:
- **Logical Stopping Points**: Complete features or components
- **Dependency Boundaries**: Points where external input is needed
- **Review Milestones**: Natural points for code review or testing
- **Integration Points**: When components need to be connected

## Quality Standards

Before finishing any project session, verify:
- [ ] Current Status accurately reflects the actual state
- [ ] All completed tasks are checked off ‚úÖ
- [ ] New tasks discovered during work are added
- [ ] File references point to correct locations with line numbers
- [ ] External references are still valid and accessible
- [ ] Next session can start immediately without confusion
- [ ] Technical decisions are documented with rationale
- [ ] Any blockers or dependencies are clearly noted

## Integration Guidelines

### TodoWrite Integration
Project documents work alongside TodoWrite for session management:
- **Project Level**: Long-term goals and context in project docs
- **Session Level**: Immediate work items in TodoWrite
- **Sync Strategy**: Transfer completed TodoWrite items to project changelog

### Git Integration
Projects complement git workflow:
- **Branch Context**: Document feature branch goals and progress
- **Commit Planning**: Use project tasks to plan logical commit boundaries
- **PR Preparation**: Project status helps write comprehensive PR descriptions

### Code Quality Integration
Project documents support quality practices:
- **Architecture Decisions**: Document design choices and trade-offs
- **Testing Strategy**: Track testing approach and coverage goals
- **Performance Goals**: Define and track performance requirements

## Example Usage

```bash
# Create new project
/project:plan "User authentication system with JWT"

# Update existing project
/project:plan "authentication-system"

# Continue work on recent project
/project:plan

# The command will:
# 1. Analyze current context and codebase
# 2. Create or load relevant project document
# 3. Update status and tasks based on current work
# 4. Provide clear next steps for development
```
